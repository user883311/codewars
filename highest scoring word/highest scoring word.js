/*
Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word.
Each letter of a word scores points according to it's position in 
the alphabet: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.
You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.
If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest 
in the original string.

All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.
